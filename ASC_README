XY coordinates as in image processing:
    X goes left to right
    Y goes up to down


V, R, L, C:

SYMBOL <comp_type_name> <node.x> <node.y> R<angle:0, 90, 180, 270>
SYMATTR InstName <node.name>
SYMATTR Value <node.value>

V advanced:
SYMBOL <comp_type_name> <node.x> <node.y> R0
WINDOW 123 24 124 Left 2                        // These 3 additional lines
WINDOW 39 0 0 Left 0                            // seem to add fake node
SYMATTR Value2 AC 1                             // to attach 'AC 1' txt
SYMATTR InstName <node.name>
SYMATTR Value <node.value>

GND:
FLAG <node.x> <node.y> 0


wires:
components by default might have 32 points of width, their coords are not in
the center, but in top left corner so points are often offset by 32/2

voltage node is offset by 16 even though it shouldn't, voltage coords
are 16 points above top center ?!?!

idky but for voltage node: top+ is at ycord+16, bottom- is at ycord+96
        ! for R0, for other rotations it may be different but idc for now
